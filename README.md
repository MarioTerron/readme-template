# Name of the project
> Additional information or tag line

A brief description of your project, what it is used for.

## ▶️ Installing / Getting started

A quick introduction of the minimal setup you need to get a hello world up &
running.

```shell
commands here
```

Here you should say what actually happens when you execute the code above.

## 🏗 Developing

### Built With
List main libraries, frameworks used including versions (React, Angular etc...)

### Prerequisites
What is needed to set up the dev environment. For instance, global dependencies or any other tools. include download links.


### Setting up Dev

Here's a brief intro about what a developer must do in order to start developing
the project further:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/your/your-project.git
cd your-project/
npm install
```

And state what happens step-by-step. If there is any virtual environment, local server or database feeder needed, explain here.

### Building

If your project needs some additional steps for the developer to build the
project after some code changes, state them here.

Here again you should state what actually happens when the code above gets
executed.

### Deploying / Publishing
Give instructions on how to build and release a new version
In case there's some step you have to take that publishes this project to a
server, this is the right time to state it.

```shell
packagemanager deploy your-project -s server.com -u username -p password
```

And again you'd need to tell what the previous code actually does.

## 📦 Versioning

We can maybe use [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning. For the versions available, see the [link to tags on this repository](/tags).


## ⚙️ Configuration

Here you should write what are all of the configurations a user can enter when
using the project.

## 🔬 Tests

Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.
Explain what these tests test and why.

```shell
Give an example
```

## 🎨 Style guide

Explain your code style and show how to check it.

## 📘 API Reference

If the api is external, link to api documentation. If not describe your api including authentication methods as well as explaining all the endpoints with their required parameters.


## 💾 Database

Explaining what database (and version) has been used. Provide download links.
Documents your database design and schemas, relations etc... 

## 📜 Licensing

State what the license is and how to find the text version of the license.
